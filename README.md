# 🏦 VanshBank: Python CLI Banking App

A command-line banking simulation project built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows users to create Normal or Savings accounts, deposit or withdraw money, view balances, and experience core OOP concepts hands-on.

---

## ✨ Features

- 💳 Create **Normal** or **Savings** account
- 💰 Deposit and withdraw funds via terminal
- 🔒 **Savings Account** includes:
  - 5% interest calculation
  - Withdrawal limit (₹10,000 max per transaction)
- 🎯 Balance display after each transaction
- 🎉 Personalized prompts and clean terminal flow

---

## 📚 OOP Concepts Used

- ✅ **Inheritance:** `SavingAccount` inherits from `NormalAccount`
- ✅ **Encapsulation:** Balance and holder data kept within each class
- ✅ **Method Overriding:** `withdraw` logic modified for savings account
- ✅ **Composition (coming soon):** Extendable with BankManager class

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then run the file
